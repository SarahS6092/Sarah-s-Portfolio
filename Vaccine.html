            <a> Many local pharmacies offer most recommended vaccines for adults. If you plan on getting vaccinated at a pharmacy, consider calling ahead to find out if the pharmacy has the vaccine you need. Ask what you will need to pay. Many vaccines are covered by health insurance. But if you don’t have insurance, try calling a few pharmacies and ask what they charge for vaccines.</a>
